# How to edit documentation

!!! note

	To edit the documentation, you need to install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)



## How to run documentation locally

- clone a repo:
	``` bash
	git clone https://github.com/chas523/chas523.github.io.git
	```
- run server
	``` bash
	mkdocs serve
	```

## How to save changes
To save the changes, it is enough to commit the files and push to the repository. The repository has piplines that will automatically build the project.
