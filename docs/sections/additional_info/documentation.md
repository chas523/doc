# How to edit documentation

!!! note

    To edit the documentation, you need to install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

## How to run documentation locally

- clone a repo:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chas523/chas523.github.io.git
  ```

- install all dependencies with pip

  ```bash
  pip install mkdocs-material
  ```

- run the server

  ```bash
  mkdocs serve
  ```

## How to save changes

To save the changes, it is enough to commit the files and push to the repository. The repository has piplines that will automatically build the project.
